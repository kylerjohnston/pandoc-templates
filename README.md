# MLA formatting, syllabus and assignment, and resume templates for pandoc

## NOTE: MLA/syllabus/assignment templates are no longer actively maintained
I changed careers and haven't written a paper or a syllabus in a few years, so these templates have not been tested in a while. Given the rate of change in the LaTeX ecosystem they probably still work fine, but I welcome pull requests from anyone actively using them who finds issues.

## Overview
This is a fork of John MacFarlane’s [pandoc-templates](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-templates) which adds some additional custom templates. I originally forked it to house a couple custom templates I had made while in an English lit grad program for producing MLA formatted papers and syllabi and assignments for the classes I was teaching. I now mostly just maintain the resume template, which is a wrapper for the [moderncv](https://ctan.org/pkg/moderncv?lang=en) LaTeX template.

Browse the `samples/` directory to see what the templates generate. Everything in the `samples/html` and `samples/pdf` directories was generated by the corresponding file in the `samples/markdown` directory.

## Install

### Requirements

The instructions below will work on OS X and \*nix systems. You’ll need to alter file paths for Windows.

You will first need to [install pandoc](http://pandoc.org/installing.html) and a LaTeX distribution. **I have only tested these templates with XeTeX**. If you’re on a Mac, I recommend installing [the MacTeX distribution](https://tug.org/mactex/).

To use the MLA template, you’ll need to download the [Modern Language Association 7th Edition Citation Style Language file from the Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles/modern-language-association) and save it to `~/.csl/modern-language-association.csl`.

The assignment and syllabus PDF templates use the [Roboto typeface](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto) which you’ll have to install on your machine.

### Installing

Step 1. Clone this repository to `~/.pandoc/templates`. Open the Terminal in OS X and type: 

    $ git clone https://github.com/kylerjohnston/pandoc-templates.git ~/.pandoc/templates

Step 2. (Kind of optional) You should copy `mla-xetex/mla-xetex.sty` to your local texmf directory and run `texhash`. `mla-xetex` is a patched version of Ryan Aycock’s [mla-paper TeX package](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/mla-paper) which will work with XeTeX (the LaTeX engine I use in the examples below---it is installed with both the full and small distributions of MacTeX and allows you to use your system’s fonts rather than dealing with complicated LaTeX font magic). **You don’t have to do this if you don’t want to use the MLA template or if you want to use pdflatex for your LaTeX engine**.

    $ cp mla-xetex/mla-xetex.sty /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/tex/latex/local/ && texhash

## Use

Each of the templates requires different YAML metadata at the beginning of your markdown file. For example, a syllabus written looks like:

    ---
    course:
      num: Markdown 101
      title: Writing Markdown, Ditching MS Word
      instructor: Kyle Johnston
      time: English bldg 200, MWF 11--12
    contact:
      email: instructor.email@institution.edu
      office: English bldg 304
      office_hours: M 3--4
      mailbox: 200
    ---

    # Heading 1

    This class is about blah blah blah

The metadata should be self-explanatory. Take a look at the samples in the `samples/markdown` directory to see the required metadata for each template.

To compile your documents as PDFs, run:

    $ pandoc document.md -o document.pdf --latex-engine=xelatex --template=assignment

The above command would compile a PDF using the assignment template. To use the syllabus template you would replace assignment with syllabus.

To compile HTML, run:

    $ pandoc document.md -o document.html -S -s --template=syllabus

The `-S` option turns on smart typography---`---` will turn into em-dashes and `--` will turn into en-dashes, straight quotes will turn curly, etc. `-s` generates a standalone HTML file you can upload to your course website, email to students, etc.

To compile an MLA document with a bibliography, you’ll need to use pandoc’s citeproc extension. You will need to put the path to your bibliography file and specify the `modern-language-association.csl` file in your YAML metadata. An example MLA markdown file might look like:

    ---
    auth:
      first: Kyle
      last: Johnston
    professor: Rodriguez
    course: English 301
    date: January 1, 2016
    title: "Plain Text Imaginaries: Markdown and the Destabilization of Compiled Idenities"
    bibliography: ~/bib/lit.bib
    csl: modern-language-association.csl
    ---

    This is your first paragraph. Etc. etc. ... To add a citation, I would do
    something like this. Marx said “The philosophers have only interpreted the
    world, in various ways; the point is to change it” [@marxTheses 20].

    ...

    \workscited

Note a couple things:

1. I wrap the title in quotation marks because it contains a colon, which would invalidate the YAML. These quotation marks won’t appear on your compiled document! They are just so that the YAML can parse correctly.

2. I cite a source by referencing its citation key.

3. I end the document with `\workscited` which will automatically generate a Works Cited page for me with all of the sources I referenced in the document.

To compile this document you would run the command:

    $ pandoc mla.md -o mla.pdf --template=mla --latex-engine=xelatex --filter pandoc-citeproc
